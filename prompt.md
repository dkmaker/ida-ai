You have the api key available as a env variable for perpelexit make a bash command that can take paramters and ask the api i need it as a "frontend" just make it in bash - make sure that the response is AI optimized and the paramteres is simple and intiuitive create a perplexity.sh command - use curl to do the requests etc. 

Perfect - i want to make a research skill for claude code @docs/skills.md that can handle research - i want to move the bash script and modify it so it helps the skill doing 
research - make a skill to research coding documentation - it should search via first perplexity - adapt the cli to this so its optimized to this - so the system prompt contains 
specifics for research documentation - when you find documentation you should always persist the documentation into a folder called researc/<topic>.md and update the CLAUDE.md in that
 file with a brief about what the file is and when to apply - the skill should always initially read that file to see if we have researched this topic before - make sure to make a 
pattern so the research used todo - and make sure to make a detailed output format so the documentation is always AI optimized and follows same patterns - it should be focues for 
documentation in gneral development 

The CLAUDE file is inteded as a INDEX so it should be that make sure that the format is defined in the skill - it should be MARKDOWN ai optimized read @docs/memory.md to understand 
how it should be created and maintained
