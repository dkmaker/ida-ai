This file serves as a **memory index** for all documentation research in this project. Claude Code automatically loads this file to help find existing research and avoid duplicates.

**Best Practices:**
- Be specific with details, not vague descriptions
- Use bullet points for easy scanning
- Keep entries current and review every 3 months
- Format consistently following the template below

EXAMPLE:

### Python Asyncio (`python-asyncio.md`)

**Researched:** 2025-11-18
**Status:** Active
**When to Use:** Building concurrent I/O-bound applications, async web servers, or async database operations
**Summary:**
- Use `asyncio.create_task()` for fire-and-forget, `asyncio.gather()` for concurrent execution with results
- Always use `async with` for async context managers to ensure proper cleanup
- Avoid blocking calls in async functions - use `asyncio.to_thread()` for CPU-bound work
